      <h3>To residents of the State of California</h3>
      <p>
        California residents have certain rights under the California Consumer
        Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and related rules concerning their personal
        information, including the rights to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Obtain the specific pieces of Information that we have collected about
          you;
        </li>
        <li>Correct inaccurate Information that we maintain about you;</li>
        <li>
          Delete certain Information that we have collected about you; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Not incur discrimination as a result of exercising any of your rights
          under the CCPA.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although we collect certain categories of Information as described
        above, we do not use it in ways that the CCPA permits you to limit. We
        do not sell your Information to third parties. In addition, the CCPA
        does not apply to personal information covered by certain
        sector-specific privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
        (GLBA) and its implementing regulations, or other information subject to
        a CCPA exception. Please contact us as we indicate below if you would
        like to discuss or exercise such rights to access, delete, or correct
        your personal information. We want you to know that the CCPA requires us
        to verify the requests we receive from you when you exercise certain of
        the rights listed above, and as part of this process, we may contact you
        after you submit your request to verify information. You may also
        designate an authorized representative to exercise certain of the rights
        listed above on your behalf. If an authorized representative submits a
        request on your behalf, we will contact you to verify that that person
        represents you.
