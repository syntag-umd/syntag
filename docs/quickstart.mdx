## SynTag API

Register with our API to train and query your own tagging models.

### Register a personal API key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Register your account">
    To start the registration process, you need to link your email to a 
    new SynTag account. Make an API request to [```/register/signup```](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/endpoint/post_register_signup)
    to recieve a verification code and authorize your account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="envelope" title="Enter your verification code">
    Once you recieve a verification code, head over to [```/register/verify```](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/endpoint/post_register_verify)
    to authorize your account. You will recieve an api_key in the body of the 
    response: SAVE THIS KEY as you will need it to access all the other endpoints.
  </Accordion>

### Train your model

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Train SynTag on your complaints">
  Once you have created a SynTag account, training your classification model is as
  easy as a single post request. Go to [```/engine/train```](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/endpoint/post_engine_train)
  to input a list of complaints (and optional tags) and your model will be ready
  by the end of the day (in most cases, by 30 minutes).
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="square-z" title="One-click train with Zendesk">
  Using Zendesk as your CRM of choice? Head over to [```/zendesk/initiate-auth```](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/endpoint/get_zendesk_initiate_auth)
  to let SynTag take a look at your customer complaints (don't worry, no human
  will be taking any peeks). Then filter your zendesk tickets at [```/zendesk/upload-tickets```](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/endpoint/post_zendesk_upload_tickets)
  and we'll send them over to SynTag in a flash!
</Accordion>

  capabilities by tagging your complaints in real-time! Whenever you have a new ticket
