Gather - When an RA is notified of a student who may be missing, the first step is trying to collect as much information as possible, including:\n   a. How long has the student been missing/out of contact?\n   b. Does the student have social media? When was the last time they posted/were seen online?\n2. Contact - The RA must attempt to contact the person and should start by knocking on the student\u2019s door. If their roommate is present, the RA should try to gather details such as the following:\n   a. When was the last time they saw the missing student(s)?\n   b. Have you heard from them since then? If so, when?\n   c. Has the student appeared to be upset or under a lot of stress lately?\n   d. Does the student have friends in the other halls or off-campus?\n\nSource 1:\n2. Support - If the resident acknowledges or affirms any thoughts of suicide contact UMPD at 301-405-3333 immediately and provide as much information as possible. Then contact the RD on Duty.  \n   a. If the resident denies any thoughts of suicide encourage a conversation with Behavioral Health and follow guidlines for \u201cMental Health\u201d situations (Page 29)\n\n3. Pre- Follow Up Information - Once UMPD arrives, be sure to take note/ ask the following:  \n   i. What hospital student is being transported (if applicable)? Note the time.  \n   ii. What is the Office Badge Number and Case Number?\n\n4. Follow Up - Call RD on Duty with an update.  \n   a. If this was reported by another resident, follow up with that person and provide resources for support.\n\nSource 2:\n2. Visit - Visit the resident's room. If the resident's roommate is there, ask to speak privately with the resident either in their room or in a space that has privacy.  \n   a. If the resident is not present, ask roommates when was the last time they saw the resident and reach out to the resident via email or chat. Call the RD to provide an update on your outreach attempts.  \n\n3. Ask - You can ask all or any of the following questions to begin the conversation:  \n   a. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d  \n   b. \u201cHow is your semester going?\u201d  \n   c. \u201cHow are your classes?\u201d\n\nSource 3:\nb. For South Campus Commons, UMPD cannot access master keys so the RA, RD, and UMPD will work together to get consent from the other residents of the unit before UMPD can enter the space.\n   c. RAs should never open a student\u2019s room door for UMPD, even if asked. If UMPD asks an RA to do this, notify the RD on Duty who will work with UMPD to determine entry protocol.\n6. Once the student is located, the RA should consult with the RD to ensure that the person who reported the concern is contacted with an update. Oftentimes, a student\u2019s parents will contact the service desk if they have not heard from their child recently. So staff may need to work with the CA to get this person\u2019s name and callback information.\n\nSource 4:\na. When was the last time they saw the missing student(s)?\n   b.
