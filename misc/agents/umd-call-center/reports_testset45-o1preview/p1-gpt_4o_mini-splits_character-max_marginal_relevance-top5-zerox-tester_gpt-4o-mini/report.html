If a resident is arrested, the RA should call the RD on duty immediately.\\n2. Document - Document the incident and collect as much information as possible. This information should include:\\n   a.

For South Campus Commons, UMPD cannot access master keys so the RA, RD, and UMPD will work together to get consent from the other residents of the unit before UMPD can enter the space.\\n   c. RAs should never open a student\\u2019s room door for UMPD, even if asked. If UMPD asks an RA to do this, notify the RD on Duty who will work with UMPD to determine entry protocol.\\n\\n","Source 0:\\nResident Assistant Duty Manual\\n\\nRemember, when in doubt; contact the Resident Director on Duty!\\n\\n# Basic Incident Response Procedures\\n\\n## How to Intervene (Confrontation Guide)\\n\\nWhen confronting incidents or misconduct, it is important to remember your role and the ways the behavior inflicts harm on our community.

Contact - The RA must attempt to contact the person and should start by knocking on the student\\u2019s door.
