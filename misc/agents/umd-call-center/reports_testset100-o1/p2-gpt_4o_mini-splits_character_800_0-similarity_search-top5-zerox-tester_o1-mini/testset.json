The cell phone is provided to create a flexible contact method while responding to incidents and carrying out other RA responsibilities while on duty. The following guidelines should always be followed regarding the cell phone:\n\nDocument 32: - RAs must always remain within their area of responsibility while on duty. Cell phones are not an excuse to go to the library, workout at the gym or elsewhere, eat a meal off-campus.\n- RAs should never use the texting feature on the duty cell phone or their own cell phone unless explicitly instructed to do so by professional duty staff.\n- RAs must ensure the cell phone carries an adequate charge at all times while on duty. Failure of cell phone function should be reported to the CA and RD on duty.\n- Proper landline phone functioning should also remain intact even if cell phones are used most frequently. All RAs are provided a landline phone in their room for this purpose.\n\nDocument 38: - If the RA is still not successful in reaching the RD on Duty, the RA should call the CD on Cell duty phone number.\n- In an emergency, the RA can also call the RD on Duty for the other side of campus for assistance if necessary.\n\n## When to Call the RD on Duty\n\nDuty and non-duty student and professional staff **must** report certain situations to the Resident Director on Duty.\n\nAlthough this list is not exhaustive and staff should always call the RD on Duty with questions, we automatically expect and require all staff to report the following:\n\nDocument 12: Resident Assistant Duty Manual\n\nThe duty RA is expected to be accessible at all times.

Duty RAs should also be available by their department-provided in-room, landline phone as a back-up.\n\nResponse: RAs are expected to respond immediately and in person to requests for assistance and support from students, CA staff, DRL professional staff, and any emergency response personnel. As such, RAs are expected to remain inside their building for the duration of their shift, with the exception of conducting rounds or responding to incidents in their area of responsibility.\n\nDocument 10: Resident Assistant Duty is a crucial component of the Department of Resident Life\u2019s crisis response system. Since crises do not always happen during business hours, the duty system is vital to ensuring the safety and security of our residents. The RA on Duty is the first level of response within their area of responsibility and is expected to respond immediately to problems occurring in their designated area.\n\n# Duty Hours\n\nWe must maintain full duty response over times when University offices are closed (e.g., after weekday business hours, weekend, snow days, etc.). The fully duty duty hour schedule for all duty staff can be found in Appendix A. Each Community\u2019s RA Staff will operate its own duty system with one primary RA and one secondary RA on duty as indicated in Appendix B.","conversation_history":[{"role":"system","content":"Remember, you are helpful support agent who answers phone calls.\n Search results will be given to you to help you answer questions.
