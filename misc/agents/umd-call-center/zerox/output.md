# Purpose of Resident Life Duty System

The Department maintains a system of duty coverage when offices are closed to ensure a prompt response to emergencies, incidents, and individuals’ needs for staff assistance since residential students live on campus 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Resident Life Community Offices operate from 8:30am - 4:30pm, Monday through Friday, so the duty system provides around the clock coverage, ensuring staff accessibility during those hours when offices are closed.

Proper functioning of the duty system is essential to our management of the residence halls and is a primary purpose of having staff live and work in the halls. The duty team consists of individuals from each level of Resident Life. Community Staff will serve in on-duty and on-call duty capacities on nights, weekends, University holidays, and other unanticipated university closures. These staff members will address safety, security, health and well-being, and behavioral concerns that require immediate or urgent attention.

More specifically, the duty system provides the following:

- Coordinated responses to emergency situations, including physiological, psychological, safety, security, and physical environment emergencies.
- Staff presence in the halls at all times, ensuring para-professional and professional staff are readily accessible to residents for meetings, mediation of conflicts, responses to requests for assistance, and emergency/crisis intervention.
- Access to responsible staff member(s) for four primary stakeholder groups which the Department serves: resident students, families of those residents, Resident Life staff, other University staff in key agencies who work cooperatively with Resident Life.
- Timely response and follow-up in situations involving potential liability and/or requiring staff accountability.
- The creation of accurate, thorough, and timely documentation for those incidents occurring while the duty system is active.

Resident Assistant Duty is a crucial component of the Department of Resident Life’s crisis response system. Since crises do not always happen during business hours, the duty system is vital to ensuring the safety and security of our residents. The RA on Duty is the first level of response within their area of responsibility and is expected to respond immediately to problems occurring in their designated area.

# Duty Hours

We must maintain full duty response over times when University offices are closed (e.g., after weekday business hours, weekend, snow days, etc.). The fully duty duty hour schedule for all duty staff can be found in Appendix A. Each Community’s RA Staff will operate its own duty system with one primary RA and one secondary RA on duty as indicated in Appendix B.

Please be aware that staff should be prepared to provide extra coverage when necessary during special events. While we make every effort to give staff ample notice when extra coverage is needed, circumstances may not always allow for this to occur.

Resident Assistant Duty Manual

The duty RA is expected to be accessible at all times. The only exception is lunch during 21- 24 hour duty shifts:
- 60 minute maximum away in dining hall on their side of campus for lunch
  - RAs are provided the following choices:
    - Option 1: Find coverage from another RA to hold the phone while you are at lunch prior to your departure
    - Option 2: Keep the phone and understand that if you receive a call you must immediately report back to the community and respond.
- RA must notify the desk and other RA in the community prior to departure
- RA providing coverage physically checks in at the desk
- Notify the desk of your departure and your return

Duty System Staff Roles

Resident Assistant (RA) on Duty
Structure: RAs, in conjunction with Community Assistant (CA) staff, are the first level of response within that area. Each RD's staff has its own RA duty rotation that covers that RD's area.

Shifts: 7:00 pm to 8:30 am on weekdays (Sunday - Thursday) and 24 hours on weekends, holidays, and other university closures.

Contact: The duty RA is primarily contacted via the department-provided cell phone assigned to their RA staff. Duty RAs should also be available by their department-provided in-room, landline phone as a back-up.

Response: RAs are expected to respond immediately and in person to requests for assistance and support from students, CA staff, DRL professional staff, and any emergency response personnel. As such, RAs are expected to remain inside their building for the duration of their shift, with the exception of conducting rounds or responding to incidents in their area of responsibility.

Purpose: Being accessible to students for mediation of conflicts and crisis intervention; Maintaining contact with the appropriate Resident Director on Duty for purposes of requesting assistance and reporting information; and documenting incidents thoroughly via the Incident Report system.

Resident Director (RD) on Duty
Structure: Duty RDs are the second level of response in the duty system, and the first line of professional staff response. During periods of full occupancy, two RDs are on duty at a time, one serving the North Campus residence halls and the other serving the South Campus. During periods of low occupancy such as summer, winter break, and spring break, one RD typically serves on duty for the entire campus.

# Duty Cell Phone Use

The primary RA on Duty must carry their staff's duty cell phone at all times while on duty. The cell phone is provided to create a flexible contact method while responding to incidents and carrying out other RA responsibilities while on duty. The following guidelines should always be followed regarding the cell phone:

- RAs must always remain within their area of responsibility while on duty. Cell phones are not an excuse to go to the library, workout at the gym or elsewhere, eat a meal off-campus.
- RAs should never use the texting feature on the duty cell phone or their own cell phone unless explicitly instructed to do so by professional duty staff.
- RAs must ensure the cell phone carries an adequate charge at all times while on duty. Failure of cell phone function should be reported to the CA and RD on duty.
- Proper landline phone functioning should also remain intact even if cell phones are used most frequently. All RAs are provided a landline phone in their room for this purpose.

The duty RA is expected to be accessible at all times. The only exception is during 21-24 hour duty shifts when RAs are provided a 60-minute lunch break at a dining hall on their side of campus. See "Duty Hours" for expectations on when RAs take lunch.

## Expectations of Non-Duty Live-On Staff
RAs who are not on duty are expected to respond to incidents that they observe and/or are reported to them. At a minimum, staff will report information they have received/observed to the appropriate level of duty staff immediately. **RAs not on duty must remain on the scene or available for immediate contact until a duty staff member responds and assumes responsibility for the situation.** At this point, the duty staff member assumes responsibility for the incident response and follow-up, including assembly of the written incident report.

## Expectations of Electronic Keybox
RAs **are not permitted** to access master keys from the electronic keybox unless directed to do so by the Resident Director or other Resident Life professional staff member.

Master keys will typically be checked out at the direction of the Resident Director during the following processes: Opening (Fall & Spring), Closing (Thanksgiving, Winter, Spring Break, and May) and Health & Safety Inspections (Fall & Spring).

## Contacting the Duty Staff
### Calling the Resident Director (RD) on Duty
Rds on Duty are equipped with cellphones as their primary contact method.
- The RD on Duty is on Duty at 4:30 pm weekdays and 24 hours when University offices are closed.
- When called while on duty, the RD must respond to a voicemail or missed call within 10 minutes.
- The RD On Duty must appear on scene if necessary within 20 minutes of the initial call.

### Unable to Reach Resident Director on Duty
If an RA is unable to reach the RD on Duty during their initial call, leave a brief voicemail with your contact information.

In the event an RA does not hear from the RD on Duty for 10+ minutes after the call, the RA should:
- **Contact the RD on Duty cell phone again**
  - If the RA doesn’t reach the RD on Duty at this point, the RA should use the alternate phone number(s) that the RD on Duty for that shift has listed as a backup in the MyDRL RD/CD Duty tracking log.

- If the RA is still not successful in reaching the RD on Duty, the RA should call the CD on Cell duty phone number.
- In an emergency, the RA can also call the RD on Duty for the other side of campus for assistance if necessary.

## When to Call the RD on Duty

Remember, when in doubt; contact the Resident Director on Duty!

# Basic Incident Response Procedures

## How to Intervene (Confrontation Guide)

When confronting incidents or misconduct, it is important to remember your role and the ways the behavior inflicts harm on our community. We do not confront people, we confront behavior. Your Resident Director (during business hours) or the RD on Duty (when main offices are closed) are always here to support and guide you through incidents. When in doubt, call for help!

1. Take a deep breath & ensure you are entering the situation as calm & level headed as possible
    a. If you are with another staff member, first discuss how the incident will be handled. Who will knock?, Who will “do the talking”?, etc
    b. If you need additional support to confront the incident, utilize your secondary. If the incident is occurring outside of “secondary hours”, contact another member of your staff or RD.

2. Knock on the resident’s door and Introduce yourself (including name & position)
    a. Ask the person you are speaking with their name

3. Explain the reason for your interaction with the residents
    a. Replace judgment with curiosity
        i. Ask how their day/night is going
    b. You should explain what you have heard, smelled, observed, etc. that has caused concern and how this is impacting others in the community.

4. Explain what you need the resident to do in order to correct the situation
    a. If necessary contact RD on Duty or UMPD for additional support.

5. Explain your requirement to document the incident for your supervisor’s review
    a. DO NOT use the term “write-up”
    b. Remember your role is to document, not to determine responsibility of violations

6. Thank the resident(s) for their cooperation and wish them a good day/night

7. Complete your IR no later than 8:30am the following day

If those involved have additional questions (such as “What is going to happen next?” “Am I going to get expelled?”, etc) refer them to the Community Living Handbook and encourage them to email your RD. Do not give your best guess as each incident is handled on a case-by-case basis. Many factors go into determining the next steps in the conduct process and we do not want to confuse students with false or misleading information.

## Entering Resident Rooms

Resident Life staff do not access student spaces except in specific circumstances.

Designated University staff does have the authority to enter a resident's room without their knowledge or consent:

- for routine or emergency repairs or replacements, inspections for maintenance or sanitation problems, assessments of damage from flooding, improvements, etc.;
- at the start of Thanksgiving, Semester and Spring breaks and during the Health & Safety Inspection process, when staff visually inspect rooms to determine whether safety, security or sanitation deficiencies exist;
- during Semester Break if weather warrants checking that heating units are working properly;
- at the end of Spring semester or a resident's occupancy in a given room as check-out inspections for cleanliness and damages occur; and
- In any emergency when appropriate staff are responding to a reported incident or believe there is serious physical or psychological distress or imminent danger to the room’s occupants or contents.

If there is an instance where a student has an alarm clock sounding, music or television playing, etc. for more than 20 minutes and is causing major disruption OR the resident will not be returning in the near future the staff member must follow the steps below:
- Contact the RD on Duty to communicate the situation
- If access is granted from the RD on Duty, the RA must:
  - Not key into a resident room alone. At minimum, 2 RAs should go together to enter a space if authorized by the Resident Director.
  - Document the situation via an incident report
  - Leave a room entry notification in the room in a visible location. The note should indicate that DRL staff entered, turned off the source of disturbance, and documented it in an incident report.

In all other situations the Resident Life staff member shall speak with the resident and ask for consent to enter the room and conduct a search. RAs must have consent from RDs any time they wish to enter a student room for any reason.

# Drugs
**Policy**
- Possession, use, sale, or provision of any controlled substance, illegal drug, or related paraphernalia is prohibited.*

* Effective July 1, 2023, the State of Maryland citizens voted in favor of a constitutional amendment that will legalize recreational cannabis use for individuals over 21 in the State. However, under federal law, cannabis is considered a controlled substance, therefore cannabis is not permitted on campus under any circumstances.

**Procedures**

2. **Assistance** - Call UMPD to explain the situation and to ask for their assistance with the incident.
   a. Never confront a situation of suspected use of drugs without UMPD present.
   b. If use of illegal drugs is detected during an interaction initiated for another reason, the RA should immediately contact UMPD for assistance.
3. **Aware** - Working with UMPD, announce to the people at the scene that you are Resident Life Staff, that you observed a concern about drugs, and that you will need to document it in an incident report.
4. **Observe** - Let UMPD manage the incident, and take notes on what you observe (seeing, hearing, smelling) in an objective manner.
   a. Follow UMPD instructions. If you have any questions or concerns throughout the incident response, call the RD On Duty.
   b. Do not touch anything for your safety and the integrity of the investigation.
   c. Some questions to ask either the people or UMPD after they follow up with the people to gather more information (but more questions can be asked or may be needed):
      i. “What are everyone's names and UID numbers?”
      ii. “Who do the drugs belong to?”
      iii. “How / When / Where did you get the drugs?”
      iv. “Who consumed the drugs? When did you consume it?”
   d. Take notes on what you observe (seeing, hearing, smelling) in an objective manner:
      i. What did the people present say in regards to the questions?
      ii. What was the result of UMPD’s interaction?
         1. If drugs are found, include in the incident report what type was found and how much was found.


2. If no drugs are found, include in the incident report that nothing was found.
3. Note if UMPD issues a citation, makes an arrest, makes a referral, or removes someone.
   iii. Does the room smell of drugs? Where is it emanating from?

5. Conclusion - Let UMPD conclude the incident. Let the people involved know that a Resident Director will reach out to schedule a meeting to initiate the Student Conduct Process. Ask the people if they have any follow-up questions or concerns (It is okay to not know the answer to questions. Encourage the people to ask those questions to the RD. Do not promise anything.). Let the people know that if anything does come up to call the Service Desk which is available 24/7. Leave the scene.

6. Follow-Up - Take note of the following scenarios to figure out follow-up:
   a. Call the RD On Duty if:

Noise
Policy
- Engaging in noisy, disorderly, or disruptive behavior, which interferes with others’ abilities to sleep, study, or be present in one’s own room or residence hall; or creates an avoidable urgent situation to which University officials are required to respond is prohibited.
- Designated quiet hours in all residence halls are from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., Sunday through Thursday evenings, and midnight to 10:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday evenings.
  - During designated quiet hours, it is expected that all residents will contain noise so it cannot be heard outside of their room with the door closed.
- Reasonable quiet is maintained 24 hours a day throughout the residence halls. These are referred to as “courtesy hours.”
  - When asked by another resident to reduce noise and/or lower the volume of your music or conversation, you will be expected to immediately do so out of courtesy to your neighbors.


# Procedures

1. **Determine** - If the situation is not a reoccurring noise violation and the students are compliant, you can issue a verbal warning. Be sure to complete any noise violations tracking per instructions from your supervisor.
   - a. However, reoccurring noise violations or students not complying with directives will need an Incident Report.
   
2. **Aware** - Once you become aware of a possible violation of noise levels, announce the following to the people at the scene:
   - a. “I am [Name], the Resident Assistant On Duty.”
   - b. “I observed the possible violation of quiet hours (Or courtesy hours).”
   - c. “I need to document it in an incident report.”

3. **Ask** - Some questions to ask to gather more information (but more questions can be asked or may be needed):
   - a. “What are everyone's names and UID numbers?”
   - b. “Who/what is the source of the noise?”
   - c. “What was the situation that led to this noise concern?”

4. **Observe** - Take objective notes on what you observe (see, hear, and smell):

Resident Follow-Up & Post Incident Follow-Up  

Procedures  
1. Request - The RD On Duty will request you to check in with a resident. Or your RD will request a check in due to RAVe.  
   a. The RD may or may not be able to share the full context of why follow-up is needed due to maintaining privacy, but they will be able to provide a general concern.  
   b. You can talk through questions to ask the resident with the RD.  
   c. Consult with the RD to determine the deadline for the follow-up.

Crisis Response Procedures  
Alcohol/Drug Transport  

Procedure:  
1. When a resident requires medical attention and intervention from staff due to intoxication from alcohol or drugs, the RA should contact UMPD at 301- 405-3333 and then the RD on Duty.  
   a. Students in medical distress are transported to local hospitals via ambulance.  
      i. Gather the following information and share with the RD on Duty:  
         1. Student Name, Campus Address, Campus Phone #, UID#, cell phone # if available  
         2. Date of birth (if under 18, note that)  
         3. Emergency Contact Person and Phone Number  
         4. Student’s permanent address  
         5. Reason for transport  
         6. Destination of transport (which hospital?) This information should be provided by either the EMT or UMPD personnel.  
         7. either the EMT or UMPD personnel.  
         8. Name and badge number of responding UMPD officer  

9. UMPD case number associated with the situation
    ii. If witnesses are present, it is also important to try to gather the following information that the RD on Duty would want to know:
        1. What drugs or alcohol did the person consume? How much and over what period of time?
        2. If alcohol is involved and the person is under the age of 2, where did they obtain the alcohol from?
        3. If a party was involved, was the event hosted by another UMD student or student organization? If so, who? Where was the event held?
b. If the student is conscious, they may choose to refuse transport via ambulance in lieu of other options, such as having a friend or another student monitor their status while they sleep. Resident Life staff are not permitted to “watch”, “supervise”, or “monitor” residents. If you are being asked to do this contact your RD or RD on Duty.
2. Write the incident report immediately after. See Incident Report (IR) Procedures section for more clarification. 
3. If the RD is unable to get in contact with the resident the following day, they may ask the RA on Duty to follow up with the resident. See Resident Follow-Up & Post Incident Follow-Up section for more details.

Considerations:
• When engaging with an intoxicated student, it is important to remember that you can not rationally communicate with someone who is intoxicated. Instead, consider asking the following questions to gauge the student's level of intoxication ahead of more serious conversation:
    • What is the year?
    • Who is the current president?
    • What building are you in?

• Symptoms of alcohol poisoning are best remembered by the pneumonic CUPS:
    • Cold, clammy, pale, or bluish skin
    • Unconscious
    • Puking repeatedly or uncontrollably
    • Slow or irregular breathing

• If a student is vomiting repeatedly or uncontrollably, ask the person’s friends or another student to turn them on their side to maintain flow of their airway.
    • RAs should never at any point touch residents or try to re-position the resident.

• If a resident needs to be transported from a local area hospital from campus, the following resources can be provided:
    • Return-from-Hospital Service from Doctors Community Hospital (Lanham), Laurel Regional Hospital (Laurel), and White Oak Medical Center (Silver Spring)
        • DOTS provides a Return-from-Hospital service from area hospitals near campus. This service is offered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week year-round when classes are in session. There is no fare and no ID required although DOTS staff may ask for a UID number to gather data about the number of transports.
        • DOTS provides hospital staff with a confidential, direct telephone number to the DOTS dispatch office to be able to request transportation back to campus on behalf of a University of Maryland student. Typically, passengers are picked up at the Emergency Room entrance within one to two hours of the request. Students who would like to use


# Bomb Threat

## Procedures:
1. **Gather** - Any person who receives a bomb threat for one of the residence halls shall:
   a. Gather as much information from the caller as possible:
      i. A phone number and/or identity of the caller  
      ii. Where the threat is located  
      iii. If there is specific timeline for plans to be executed  
   b. Call UMPD at (301) 405- 3555 to report the threat. **(DO NOT PULL FIRE ALARM)**  
   c. Contact the RD on Duty and follow instructions given.  
   
2. **Evacuate** - If UMPD confirms that there is an active bomb threat, the police or fire department will pull the fire alarm. Mandatory evacuation procedures must be followed. (If no bomb threat is found, police shall inform the RA the search is inconclusive and anyone who chose to evacuate may re-enter at their discretion.)
   a. The RA should notify the CA of an evacuation and then evacuate **IMMEDIATELY**.  
   b. The RA should contact the RD on Duty to provide an update.  

3. **Document** - Document the incident and collect as much information as possible. This information should include:
   a. Names and UIDs of the involved student(s)  
   b. Time and location the incident occurred  
   c. Action taken by Resident Life and UMPD  

## Considerations:
- Evacuation assembly areas can be found in Appendix F.

# Fire or Fire Alarm 

## General Procedure For All Residents
- **Sound Alarm**: If smoke or fire is observed, pull the nearest fire alarm pull-station, activating alarm bells throughout the building to alert other residents of the fire emergency. Pulling the fire alarm station saves lives.
  
- **Use the Nearest Exit or Exit Stairwell**: Immediately exit the building upon hearing an alarm, even if you have not seen smoke or fire. Use the nearest stairwell to exit.
  - Do not wait for confirmation of an actual fire or assume the alarm is a false alarm.
  - Evacuate immediately, even if fire and smoke are not apparent.  
  - Do not use the elevator. Elevators enter into a “fire service” mode and may not respond to calls when the fire alarm system has been activated. Occupants may become trapped in elevators.
  - Do not attempt to locate the fire.  
  - Do not attempt to fight or extinguish the fire.  
  - Do not re-enter the building until the fire department gives authorization.  
  - Assemble. Each hall has a designated outside assembly area to avoid hindering fire.


# Procedures:
If an RA hears an alarm or are notified of a fire emergency  
1. **Call** - UMPD at 301-405-3333 (NOT 911) or using a blue light phone to report the emergency or confirm it has been reported. Although it is likely others have done so, make the call yourself to guarantee that emergency personnel were notified.  
2. **Verify** - the Service Desk has been informed. Where the service desk is in a different building and therefore may not hear the fire alarm, (Annapolis, Queen Anne’s Prince Frederick, South Campus Commons, Leonardtown, Cumberland, and Centreville) it is essential that the building’s RAs take responsibility to notify the Service Desk.  
3. **Call** - the RD on-duty or contact the Community Office during business hours.  
4. **Report** - to the emergency assembly area. Remain outside.  
5. **Introduce** - yourself to police or other emergency staff. Remain outside and available as a resource to the RD or emergency staff. After the incident has been resolved, RAs should ask emergency staff the location and cause of the fire to be included in the incident report.  
6. **Wait** - at the main entrance for emergency personnel. Do not enter the building/residential floors.  
7. **Provide access** - if emergency personnel need access through a locked door.  
8. **Assist** - the RD or emergency personnel as requested and appropriate. Help keep residents quiet.  
9. **Prevent** - residents from re-entering the building until authorized to do so by the Fire Department.  
10. **Check and secure** - exterior doors when the incident is over.  
11. **Notify** - Residential Facilities at (301) 314-WORK* of doors that need to be electronically reset or relocked (except they page a staff member on-duty to respond immediately).  
    a. *In the case of South Campus Commons the RA should contact Service Desk 1 at (301)226-0001 to reach the Capstone Student Staff on Duty instead of calling (301) 314-WORK.*  
12. **Document** - Write the incident report immediately after. See Incident Report (IR) Procedures section for more clarification.  

# Considerations:
- Residence Hall fire alarm systems are monitored at the Department of Public Safety, but detailed information on the fire still needs to be reported.  
- South Campus Commons fire alarm systems are monitored by a private monitoring company.  
- On a cell phone dialing 911 sends the call to Prince George’s County Emergency rather than the University Police.  
- Evacuation assembly areas can be found in Appendix F.  

# Resources:
- **After a Fire**  
  - Resident Life, Environmental Safety, and UMPD have an extensive process for follow-up and  


investigation of fires. Police and fire investigators will arrive on scene and will want to talk with anyone who was in the area at the time of the fire and with the person who reported the fire. The decision that a room is uninhabitable and that residents are to be relocated temporarily will be made by the Resident Director after appropriate consultation with all relevant parties.

Fire Watch
A Fire Watch is an hourly foot patrol conducted when a building's fire alarm system is down. It provides fire and smoke detection and emergency warning of occupants via air horns or other means of emergency conditions.

Procedures:
The State Fire Marshall requires that “at least one sober, responsible individual per building” is assigned to staff a Fire Watch.

1. Fire Watch staff must conduct a continuous foot patrol with no more than a 15-minute break each hour.
   a. Staff must remain alert, awake, and physically located near the service desk or lobby area at all times except when conducting an inspection.
   b. Fire Watch staff may not leave the building or return to their room.

2. Receive a Fire Watch Log sheet from the Service Desk.
   a. Update the Log sheet each hour by entering the date and time of each inspection tour and legible signature of the person performing the inspection. The Fire Watch Log will be picked up by a fire inspector when the alarm is repaired.

3. Receive air horns and cartridge packs from the service desk. 

4. Obtain Fire Watch notes from the service desk and post in the lobby(s), elevators, on bulletin boards, and on bathroom doors.

5. Conduct a continuous inspection of the entire building, breaking for no more than 15 minutes each hour. The inspection must include corridors, lounges, stairwells, laundry rooms, recreation rooms, basements, lobbies, and any other common areas. Be alert to indications of smoke or fire.

6. At the first evidence of smoke or fire:
   a. Pull the nearest fire alarm pull station (the alarm may not sound during some outages, but this step should always be taken/attempted). If the alarm does not sound, blast your Air Horn as you are exiting.
   b. Call UMPD at (301) 405-3555.
   c. Call the service desk.
   d. Proceed to the closest building exit immediately, sounding the air horn to notify as many residents as possible en route.

7. At the conclusion of the Fire Watch, as notified by 4-WORK, return supplies to the service desk, remove notices, and submit completed log to the Resident Director.

Missing Student
Procedures
1. Gather - When an RA is notified of a student who may be missing, the first step is trying to collect as much information as possible, including:
   a. How long has the student been missing/out of contact?
   b. Does the student have social media? When was the last time they posted/were seen online?
2. Contact - The RA must attempt to contact the person and should start by knocking on the student’s door. If their roommate is present, the RA should try to gather details such as the following:
   a. When was the last time they saw the missing student(s)?
   b. Have you heard from them since then? If so, when?
   c. Has the student appeared to be upset or under a lot of stress lately?
   d. Does the student have friends in the other halls or off-campus?
   e. Has anyone checked the student’s social media status updates (Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)?

Resident Assistant Duty Manual 29

3. Contact Attempt #2 - If the student is not located after knocking on the room door, the RA should try calling the student using the RA duty phone or service desk phone.
4. If the student still is not found, the RA should contact the RD on Duty.
5. The RD will determine whether or not the UMPD should be involved.
   a. If UMPD arrives to enter the student's room for a wellness check, they will arrive with their own master keys.
   b. For South Campus Commons, UMPD cannot access master keys so the RA, RD, and UMPD will work together to get consent from the other residents of the unit before UMPD can enter the space.
   c. RAs should never open a student’s room door for UMPD, even if asked. If UMPD asks an RA to do this, notify the RD on Duty who will work with UMPD to determine entry protocol.
6. Once the student is located, the RA should consult with the RD to ensure that the person who reported the concern is contacted with an update. Oftentimes, a student’s parents will contact the service desk if they have not heard from their child recently. So staff may need to work with the CA to get this person’s name and callback information.
   a. Provide assistance but do NOT provide any information regarding an active or past incident - including resident location, room number, class schedule, or other identifying information due to FERPA. Have the resident contact the concerned party directly so that they are able to receive an update

Physical Altercation/ Fight 
Policy:
- Causing physical harm or a reasonable expectation of physical harm to any person is prohibited.

Procedures:
1. Observe - If an RA becomes aware or observes a physical altercation/ fight, they should contact UMPD at (301) 405-3333 immediately. RAs should at no point attempt to break up a physical altercation.
   a. Provide as much information and detail to UMPD as possible
   b. If residents flee, note which direction they went and communicate to UMPD. At no point should an RA chase after an individual.
   c. If a resident is arrested, the RA should call the RD on duty immediately.
2. Document - Document the incident and collect as much information as possible. This information should include:
   a. Name and UIDs of the involved student(s)
   b. Time the incident occurred
   c. Was anyone injured? If so, what injuries did they have?

5. At no point, should Resident Life staff transport students to local area hospitals.
6. Resident Life staff are not permitted to “watch”, “supervise” or “monitor” residents. If you are being asked to do this contact your RD or RD on Duty.

- **Health Center Van**
    - The Health Center Van is available for return trips to campus from area hospitals after a student is transported from campus to the hospital by the police or ambulance. Only Health Center staff may request rides on behalf of students and the arrangements are made from the Health Center’s Urgent Care Unit/Walk-In Clinic. Use of the van is subject to vehicle and driver availability.
- **Return-from-Hospital Service from Doctors Community Hospital (Lanham), Laurel Regional Hospital (Laurel), and White Oak Medical Center (Silver Spring)**
    - DOTS provides a Return-from-Hospital service from area hospitals near campus. This service is offered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week year-round when classes are in session. There is no fare and no ID required although DOTS staff may ask for a UID number to gather data about the number of transports.

# Appendix G - Incident Report (IR) Writing Procedures

The Department of Resident Life relies significantly on the information reported in incident reports. Therefore, when an incident report (IR) is filed, it is important to remember several things:

## Incident reports should be written in 3rd person.

### Identifying individuals in the narrative

- **When you identify a person the first time in an IR, add their position/role w/ First & Last Name.**
  - Resident Assistant (RA) Darryl Pines
  - Community Director (CD) Jordan Adams
  - Resident Director on Duty (RD) Esmeralda Roman
  - Resident Keira Martone
  - Non- Resident Tion Taylor
  - UMPD Ofc. Nardella

- **Any subsequent mention of the person, add their position/role w/ LAST NAME.**
  - RA Pines
  - CD Adams
  - RD on Duty Roman
  - Resident Martone
  - Non- resident Taylor
  - UMPD Ofc. Nardella

### IRs should contain factual information and consider the following:
- who,
- what,
- when,
- where,
- and any obvious reason why.

### Avoid subjective information, i.e. "the student was drunk."
- What does that mean?
- Why did you make that assumption?
  - Instead "the student appeared intoxicated due to their loud, slurred speech, the smell of alcohol on their breath, and their general behavior and demeanor."
- Avoid using words like mad, angry, sad, emotional and other phrases that are to open interpretation.
- Avoid using words like "lots", "many", "a multitude" or other uncertain references to quantity. Specify "7" or "more than 10."
- Do not draw personal conclusions. For example, do not put in the IR the sanction that you feel.

- the student should receive.
- Be concise, put down what happened and avoid extraneous material.
  - Be clear in describing the event, making it so a person who was not there would be able to understand the incident by your report.
- Make sure the IR is both complete and legible from a grammar perspective. Review for typos.
