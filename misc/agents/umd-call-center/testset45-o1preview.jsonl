Before you begin asking questions, remind the resident that you are a mandatory reporter and that you will need to share information about the conversation with your supervisor if there is a serious concern. Emphasize that information will only be shared up to staff that are here to support them (your supervisors) and won\u2019t be shared out (to students or other RAs).  \n\nResident Assistant Duty Manual  \n17","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":84,"distracting_context":"## Procedure  \n1. **Gather** - RA should gather information from the source who is reporting concern for a resident\u2019s mental health wellbeing.  \n2. **Support** - Check in with resident:  \n   a.
