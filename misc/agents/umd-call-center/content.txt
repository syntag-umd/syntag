Introduction to the department of residential facilities
Welcome to the Department of Residential Facilities and congratulations on your position with us! We are happy you have chosen to become a valued member of our student staff and the Service Center Desk.
Residential Facilities provides a wide variety of routine, emergency and scheduled services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We rely on the campus’ Department of Facilities Maintenance for some services; however the principle services received by the residents are directly delivered by Residential Facilities staff. We deliver service to a number of campus buildings – 48 residence halls, 21 fraternity & sorority houses and 3 campus recreation buildings.
The Department of Residential Facilities has responsibility for nearly:
2.1 million square feet of undergraduate residence halls
190,000 square feet of renovated fraternity & sorority buildings
297,000 square feet of new or renovated recreation facilities
Introduction to & purpose of the service center
The Service Center is the main communications hub for the majority of the work of the Department of Residential Facilities. It is a 24 hours / 7 days a week / 365 days a year operation staffed by about 30 part-time student workers, 2-3 part-time student supervisors and 2 full-time managers. Student employees generally work in 3-hour shifts increments. The Service Center Desk is generally single staffed every day between the hours of 12am-6am and 6am-9am on Saturdays and Sundays. We are normally triple or double-staffed all other times between the hours of 6am-12am.
Student employees play an important role in the department’s effort to provide safe, clean and well maintained accommodations for campus residence halls, guests and staff and the campus recreational facilities. Each year the hard work of our student employees contributes directly to the ongoing improvement of the campus’ housing facilities and related services. We hope you find your student position to be a valuable, educational, challenging, supportive and beneficial part of your overall experience at the University of Maryland.
This handbook is designed to present and familiarize you with the expectations, policies and procedures associated with working at the Service Center. Although much of the handbook deals with “do’s and don’ts,” our hope is that most students will use this as a general reference and use the information to better understand the role and expectations of their position. While your supervisor(s) will likely review with you some of the specific policies/requirements, you are encouraged to bring any questions or concerns to the attention of your supervisor(s).
Service Center Staff are referred to as “Desk Associates” and are often the first voice heard or the first person seen by many of our customers. It is important that every Desk Associate be courteous and provide residents, parents, university staff, contractors and co-workers with superior customer service based on the values of the Department of Residential Facilities. Every interaction with a customer is critical and will leave an impression with the caller / visitor about the University, the Department of Residential Facilities, and most of all the Service Center.
Desk Associates must develop an understanding that every duty performed directly impacts the success of individuals in the department and the safety of our residents. The quality of work done as well as the overall image of the Service Center staff requires everyone to perform their work in a professional manner and as a team.
The Service Center is a space requiring everyone to function in a neat and organized manner. Since it is a visible space to our visitors and other department staff, the work area should display a message to our customers that we take pride in what we do and we do it well. Proper desk presentation of our physical work space is expected at all times. The Service Center Desk areas should be kept neat and tidy. Staff should take care of their space and take a few minutes during each shift to ensure all items and resources are put back in their designated locations (pens in the holder, binders on the back shelf, paperwork in the correct places, etc.)
general expectations of desk associates
The nature of your role as a Desk Associate means you will have contact with potentially sensitive information, account numbers, phone numbers, student housing records and personnel records. Staff should remember to secure all information in an appropriate manner and handle it with confidentiality in mind.
Documents, keys, swipes and equipment should only be used for direct work related tasks and with authorization. Staff should not alter, falsify or fraudulently construct any document, key or swipe. Doing so could result in immediate termination from the Desk Associate position.
Employees are encouraged to express their suggestions or concerns about work tasks and methods, particularly in instances where the employee believes their safety is being jeopardized. Your safety is a primary concern to us; we expect staff to perform assigned tasks following established safety procedures to prevent injury to themselves or others. If you are not sure how to safely perform a given task, please ask your supervisor for guidance.
Suggestions are also welcomed and encouraged regarding new procedures or changes in current procedures or policies.
Good communication is essential to productive work relationships. Work concerns or questions should first be directed to your supervisor, who is likely in the best position to address such issues. If your supervisor is not available, or may be the source of your concern(s), it is appropriate to go to someone else in the supervisory chain. If, for some reason, you feel you cannot bring your concern(s) or question(s) to anyone at the Service Center, you can bring them to the Manager of Employee Services.
Desk Associates are generally responsible for:
Receiving Service Requests (SRs) from our customers, prioritizing the work, printing Service Requests, distributing them to the correct shop, investigating inquiries, and closing Service Requests once the work has been verified as completed.
Maintaining the safety and security of Residential Facilities keys, which are assigned to the department and referred to as the “A” key box. The desk is responsible for issuing these keys to authorized personnel to complete work assignments in the designated buildings maintained by DRF. Desk Associates also audit the keys on a regular basis (every shift) to assist with maintaining an accurate inventory.
Coordinating various communication systems which include:
Managing cell phones for professional staff in Residential Facilities. We deliver messages through these electronic devices regarding Service Requests, outages and other communications.
Working with staff from the Department of Facilities Maintenance (DFM) and Resident Life to initiate and terminate fire watches - an alternative fire alarm system used when installed fire alarm or sprinkler systems are out of service.
Initiating the Department’s response to severe weather events or campus closure, including the Snow Plan. Service Center staff will contact Snow Plan team members at home and inform them of the start or termination of the plan.
Staff are expected to provide their full attention to assigned tasks and duties while working. Therefore, the following guidelines have been established:
Night Shift (6pm – 6am) and Weekends
All work placed in the “Work to Be Completed” box (Service Requests to be closed, inspection forms to enter, and one-steps to process) must be completed. In general, there are fewer phone calls during the evening, which allows more time to process paperwork. Staff should complete as many work tasks as possible during their shift, not leaving work for the next shift because they wish to complete non-work related tasks. At the end of a shift, staff should notify their replacement of any remaining work to be completed. Every staff member is expected to do their fair share of our work. Reports are generated nightly that show exactly how many work related tasks are completed by each staff member and it’s easy for supervisors to follow up and see who is / is not doing work. Staff who consistently do not complete their share of work may lose priority points and / or be placed on job probation.
Studying
All job related assignments and tasks should be given primary attention while working. You are permitted to study only after all regularly scheduled work and special assignments are completed. In the event that more tasks come about, you must stop studying and complete those tasks. When studying, staff should be cognizant of not having too many materials spread out all over the desk, such that it negatively impacts their ability to answer phones or complete work tasks. Please keep these expectations in mind during heavy exam periods as well and do not schedule yourself to work if studying needs to be a priority.
Clothing
Employees are expected to wear appropriate clothing and be aware that certain pictures, symbols, or wording on their clothing may be offensive to fellow staff members, guests or customers. Examples of offensive attire include clothing with foul language, sexually explicit symbols, pictures or messages and derogatory racial, ethnic, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation related connotations. Shorts must be in good condition (e.g., not overly frayed or with conspicuous tears or holes), and must be of an appropriate length. Shirts should fully cover a person’s body (no muscle shirts with wide arms.) Remember that you are moving and bending and consider how those movements may cause exposure. Department managers and supervisors have the final word on whether or not specific clothing is appropriate work attire, and employees may be asked to change their clothing if a manager or supervisor judges an employee’s attire to be inappropriate or offensive in nature.
Laptops, Tablets, and Gaming Devices
Laptops and tablets are only permitted to be out at the desk once all work has been completed and between the hours of 6pm and 6am (1800-0600). Gaming devices (ex: Switch) are not permitted. Laptops may be permitted during the summer, if triple-staffed, and only during slower times (not during key rush shifts) with permission from the Student Supervisors, Assistant Manager or Manager.
Cellphones & Earbuds
Cell phone use should be limited while working at the Service Center desk. Staff are permitted to have their phones out but should not be playing games, watching movies, excessively checking email or texting while working. Facetiming is not permitted. Should this become a problem or the phone become a distraction from work to be completed, staff may be asked to leave their phone with the Assistant Manager or Manager while working.
Music & Earbuds
Music may be on / played to provide low, background music. Music should not be offensive or crude in nature and the volume should be kept low enough so as not to interfere with the staff member’s ability to answer the phone or provide service to someone at the window.
Headphones, earbuds or earpods are permitted outside of normal business hours and on breaks, but only if it does not affect your performance while working.
Snacking / Eating
A kitchen with a microwave, refrigerator and various appliances is provided for staff to utilize in the Service Center. Employees are permitted to eat at the center table or in the kitchen while working as long as their work performance is not adversely affected and they are still able to help out their fellow staff member if need be (during the day.) Staff should not eat or drink near any computer equipment, as crumbs and spills and the potential insects those items attract can cause serious damage (covered drinks are permitted.) Desk Associates should clean up after themselves, dispose of all leftover trash, food debris, package wrapping and recycle when appropriate. If leaving the Service Center to purchase food (taking a break), staff should be sure to clock in/out appropriately.
Staff are permitted to leave food items in the provided kitchen and cabinets, but should be aware that items could be eaten by others or discarded at any time. If staff choose to leave items, they should be clearly labeled with a name and should only be stored here for a short time.
Telephone Use
Service Center phones are for business purposes only. Any personal phone calls should be limited to extenuating circumstances for an emergency nature that cannot be made using a personal cell phone or involve a last minute schedule change for the purpose of notifying family or friends of the change. Emergency calls of this nature should be infrequent and limited in duration. Phone records are reviewed each month by the Manager and staff members may be asked to reimburse the university for any misuse of the phones. If needed to be used, personal cell phones may be used for a short duration in the back (by the coat rack.) Staff who do not comply with these guidelines are subject to disciplinary action.
Computer Use
Staff will be provided access to the department’s computer network and desktop PCs as part of their work. These computer resources are for work related tasks only and not for personal use. All computers are set with limits as to what the user can access. Users are responsible for safeguarding their log ins and passwords and are responsible for all transactions made under their ID. The following activities are prohibited:
Altering any PC, hardware, software, desktop file(s), network file(s) or configuration of any other component of the system.
Attempting to access or accessing another user’s account.
Accessing the internet, personal email servers or any other computer resources not directly related to work duties.
Using computer resources for illegal activities. Criminal and illegal use may include: obscenity, child pornography, threats, harassment, copyright infringement, defamation, online gambling and unauthorized access.
Staff who do not comply with these guidelines are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Work Spaces / Stations
Employees are encouraged to only bring minimal personal items to work. Personal items (purses, lunch materials, book bags, etc.) must be stored so they do not disrupt work activities. The department cannot assume responsibility for personal items stored during the work day or left overnight.
Each employee is responsible for keeping their personal and group work spaces clean and organized. Supplies should be kept orderly for use by other employees and trash/waste should be cleared from affected areas as soon as possible.
*Remember – our entire staff provide service to our customers at all times. A customer should never be asked to wait on the phone or at the window while a staff member completes a homework problem, has a conversation with a
co-worker, finishes reading a paragraph or wraps up a personal phone call.*
Staff should demonstrate respect for individual differences. Employees will refrain from comments that degrade or joke about gender, gender identity, race, religion, age, sexual orientation, national origin, or color. Harassment or offensive behavior should immediately be reported to the Service Center Manager. This type of behavior will not be tolerated and can result in immediate termination.
Employees provoking and/or participating in fights or other physical confrontations may be terminated immediately.
WORK BREAKS & LUNCH/DINNER PERIODS
Since the Service Center must be staffed at all times, staff are not allowed a lunch / dinner break. The exception to this will be staff working a double shift (6+ hours). These employees will be allowed a 30-minute lunch/dinner break if more than one staff member is on duty. If a staff member chooses to take a lunch / dinner break, they must secure adequate desk coverage, get authorization from a supervisor and clock out during the break period.
During business hours, if only one person is working and they wish to take a bathroom break, they must ask a supervisor to cover the desk for them. It is never acceptable to leave the desk unattended during normal business hours.
If a staff member needs to take a bathroom break during a shift when only one person is working, they must place the “back in 5 minutes” sign in the window and send all calls directly to voicemail. Staff are required to check voicemail immediately upon returning (see the Operations Manual for instructions on how to do this.) Please keep in mind that these breaks should be of limited duration and frequency.
If employees elect to go off campus to order or pick up food (i.e., Bagels and Grinds, Potomac Pizza, McDonalds, Chipotle, etc.) they are expected to clock out when they leave and clock back in when they return. This option is only available when there is more than one staff member working during non-business hours, unless given permission by the Assistant Manager or Manager. Staff are permitted to go to the vending machine without clocking out as long as they are only gone for less than a few minutes. Again, staff should not be leaving the building, for any reason, when only one person is working a shift.
As mentioned previously, on pages 6 - 7, all eating and snacking should occur in the kitchen or at the center table area and staff should clean up after themselves at all times.
reporting to work, lateness & substitutes
Shift attendance and staff meetings are mandatory. Center employees are expected to report to work at least 5 minutes before the start of their scheduled shift. Regular, predictable attendance and adherence to work schedules are important to maintaining the quality of our service, the confidence of our customers and the positive working relationships and rapport present among staff members.
Employees are encouraged to make arrangements and overestimate the time necessary for travel to work so that lateness will be prevented. Staff should also pay close attention to the times when traffic is heavier around campus (residence hall opening / closing days, graduation events, sporting events, etc.) Employees are responsible for scheduling personal activities so that arrival to work is not in conflict with other commitments.
Employees are expected to be ready to work once they have clocked in; after clocking in, employees may not leave their designated work area(s) or return to their suite / apartment / room without clocking out and/or receiving authorization from their supervisor.
Frequent lateness and/or lateness of a significant time period can affect the operations of our unit as well as employee morale. The department understands that occasionally employees may experience personal difficulties that prevent them from arriving to work on time. Infrequent occasions of lateness will generally not result in disciplinary action. However, frequent lateness or lateness of a significant time period (more than 5 or 10 minutes) without an acceptable excuse will result in disciplinary job action and a loss of up to 25 priority points.
If someone does not show up by the time their shift starts, the staff member working should contact that person via a phone call and text. You must do both – simply texting is not enough. Be sure to leave a voicemail if there is no answer. Wait 5 minutes for a response and call again. If there is no response within 10 minutes, then contact the Supervisor on Call for assistance in determining what steps to take next. Staff should not contact the Supervisor on Call without first reaching out to the person who was scheduled to work.
If the person currently working can stay and agrees to stay and cover for the late individual, then both parties should sign the “Late Coverage Log” indicating the coverage. It is not a requirement to stay, but is appreciated if individuals are able and willing to help out. Having someone “cover” only means the late individual will not lose priority points for being late. It does not mean they are exempt from being held accountable in other ways for being late (letter of warning, probation, etc.) For double-staffed shifts, the other individual currently scheduled to work cannot cover for the individual who is going to be late. For example, if Sally is currently working 12pm-3pm and Billy is going to be 30 minutes late, Billy cannot ask Sally to cover for him. It would need to be someone who is not currently scheduled to work.
If a staff member is unable to report on time and will be late, they are expected to immediately call the Service Center Desk and inform the person currently working and see if that person can stay. If the person cannot stay, then the person reporting to work, who will be late, must contact the Assistant Manager, Manager or Supervisor on Call (if after hours or on a weekend) for assistance.
If an employee cannot work a shift that he/she is scheduled for or assigned, he/she MUST secure a substitute. A staff roster of all current Service Center employees is provided to each employee when he/she begins employment. Up-to-date lists are posted in the Service Center area and distributed via regularly scheduled staff meetings. Staff are highly encouraged to add everyone to their phone and email contact lists for ease of reaching out in times of need.
In the event staff must find a substitute, he/she should contact other Service Center employees in person or by phone, email or text to see if they are willing to substitute on the required date. After finding someone who is willing to substitute, both staff members must complete the Substitution Log. The coverage should also be noted on the whiteboard and paper schedule.
If the substitute does not report for the shift and has not signed the Service Center Staff Substitution Log, then the original (scheduled/assigned) staff member will be held responsible for the missed shift.
We currently use a color-coded scheduling system:
Red = shifts someone cannot work for whatever reason
Blue = shifts someone could work if need be, but they would like to give them up
Green = initials of the person who took a shift for someone that they could not / did not want to work
If a staff member is looking to secure a substitute, they can place their shifts on the board in red or blue. Staff should also understand this is only the first step in finding coverage. They must reach out to fellow staff members. Simply putting a shift in red or blue and not securing coverage is not acceptable. If staff are unable to find a substitute, then they are still responsible for working the shift. Please note the availability of substitutes can be extremely limited at times (between spring closing & summer opening and summer closing & fall opening) so staff should not plan on multiple substitutions during those times.
When an absence is considered excused, the staff member will not receive disciplinary job action. When an absence is considered unexcused, the student will receive a disciplinary job action, including the possibility of a loss of priority points, probation or termination.
Regardless of reason for attendance problems, staff who are frequently late and/or absent may be terminated or asked to resign.
parking while working at the service center
When reporting to work, it is the employee’s responsibility to ensure that he/she is parked in a legal or authorized parking space/lot. Employees are responsible for paying any parking tickets they receive on their personal vehicles.
Many years ago we worked with DOTS to secure two Service Center student parking permits. These permits may only be checked out and used by Desk Associate Service Center staff during their specific work shifts at the Service Center Desk. The permits are available on a first-come, first-serve basis by the employees currently scheduled to work at the desk and an employee may only check-out one (1) permit at a time to use while working at the Service Center Desk. At the end of the shift, the employee must return the permit to the Service Center and have it checked back in. The permits may be used only for the duration of your Service Center work shift and may not be used in your vehicle while you attend class or any other campus event or activity. Permits are intended to be used by Desk Associates working their scheduled shifts. Student supervisors may use the permit, if available, and not needed by a Desk Associate, but Desk Associates always have priority for the permits.
These parking permits have been issued to us for short-term temporary use while working at the Service Center and are a privilege; their misuse is not only grounds for termination from employment, but also may result in severe financial and/or disciplinary penalties imposed by the University.
These permits are only valid for use in valid parking spaces in Lot #17a-d, which are located near Building 201, beside the Police Caged Impound Area and around portions of the Leonardtown Community. The parking permits are not valid for use in any other parking lot on campus. If issued a parking ticket while using one of these permits outside of Lot 17, or in a handicapped space, fire lane, meter, or other restricted parking area, staff will be responsible for payment of that ticket. When deciding where to park, keep in mind that the fine for the illegal display and/or receipt of a parking permit is currently $300.00, and you will be responsible for whatever fine is assessed to you by the Department of Transportation Services.
If you have a student parking permit, remove it from your mirror before hanging one of the Service Center parking permits in your vehicle. At the end of the shift, hang your own student parking permit back up on your mirror and quickly return the Service Center parking permit to the Service Center Desk. Students who have on-campus parking permits can also choose to have their permits “split”, which means they can park in Lot 17 without displaying our permit and also still park in their designated space. Students who may be interested this option should speak with the Assistant Manager or Manager for assistance. It may take a few weeks for DRF staff to secure this ability with DOTS.
In general, these permits should only need to be used Monday through Friday, between 7am and 4pm so that a Service Center employee can park in Lot 17 during the day. Outside of those hours, parking without a permit is typically available in Lot N5 (closest to Building 201). Therefore, the only time we would anticipate these permits being issued out to Service Center employees is Monday through Friday, for shifts worked between the hours of 6am and 6pm. Recognizing there may be occasions when Lot N5 is full after hours or on weekends, if staff arrive at work and Lot N5 is full and there is no other option but to park in Lot 17, staff should note that explanation on the keyslip when they are issued the permit.
The Service Center parking permits will be issued by one Service Center employee currently working to another Service Center employee at the start of their shift and signed out on a keyslip. (This means staff may not sign a permit out to themselves.) The keyslip will be placed in the rack on the wall along with all of the other “active” keyslips until the permit is returned at the end of the employee’s shift(s) to the Service Center employee who is working the shift that follows them. (This means you may not sign the permit back in yourself.) In order to ensure consistent tracking and monitoring of these permits, both permits will be included in the master audit process and kept in the keybox when not in use. If a permit is not returned, the Service Center employee performing the audit will contact the employee who has signed out the permit and request that it be returned. If the permit is not returned within one (1) hour of the call being made, the Service Center Supervisor on-Call, Assistant Manager, Manager, or Assistant Director will be notified.
Employees who do not return the permit at the end of their shift(s), will not be allowed to check out the Service Center Parking Permit in the future. If the permit is not returned by 6am the following business day, that will be considered theft of University property, and referred to the University of Maryland Police Department and Office of Student Conduct for investigation.
If a permit is not available (they are all signed out), then staff are responsible for securing their own parking. Meters are available in Lot 17 or staff may elect to park on College Park city streets. If parking on the street, staff should be aware of the 2-hour time restriction. Cars will need to be moved to a completely different street every 2 hours. Desk Associates should carefully read all city parking signs and understand they are responsible for any tickets they may receive for not properly following instructions or parking in a space they are not permitted to.
inclement weather
University closures / delayed openings are reported to the campus community through the 5-SNOW line, UMD text alerts, local news stations and online via www.umd.edu. When the University is closed due to inclement weather, residence halls, Greek houses, campus recreational services and residence hall service desks remain open, but all University offices close. The Resident Life duty system remains in effect (RAs on Duty, RDs on Duty and CD on Call) as well. As the Service Center is a point of contact for many listed above, it is essential for us to work collectively to maintain operations during weather emergencies and unexpected crises. Many DRF operations continue during weather related closings. The Service Center is our operational hub and therefore needs to maintain staffing 24 / 7 to assist with handle incoming calls and requests.
In the event the University has an unscheduled closing (e.g. inclement weather), Service Center employees are still expected and required to report for their shifts. A university decision to cancel classes does not excuse any student from scheduled shifts. Failure to report or find coverage for your shift may result in disciplinary action, as this would be considered a missed shift.
Shifts worked during these times may be compensated at an incentive rate, currently $1.00 above the employee’s established hourly rate.
If a staff member is not able to safely travel to campus, they must contact other staff members and find coverage for their shift. Staff are encouraged to pay attention to the weather and communicate in advance with others to arrange for potential coverage or assistance with shifts.
University id cards
University/student identification cards serve 3 purposes for Residential Facilities students and regular staff. The card serves as your employee photo-identification card, is used for time clock reporting and also provides access to the Service Building after hours and on weekends (when doors are locked and secured). Staff must always have their university ID card when working but do not need to wear it or openly display it while working at the Service Center window.
Employees are expected to provide their identification card upon request to any member of the university community.
Use of staff cards for any other purpose than authorized, work related access, employee identification and time reporting may result in disciplinary action. ID cards should not be altered, modified or changed in any way. If an ID card is inaccurate, deteriorating or damaged in any way, a request for replacement at the Mitchell Building should be made as soon as possible.
If a Desk Associate loses their university ID card, they should immediately inform the Assistant Manager or Manager. There is an expectation that the university ID card should be replaced with 3 business days (at the Mitchell Building.)
Employees must show ID:
Prior to issuance of keys & access cards from any keybox
When requested by any member of the university community such as residents, summer guests, police, etc. (Note – failing to provide your ID is a violation of campus policy and may result in a request to leave the premises and will constitute trespassing under the Criminal Code of Maryland.)
In order to gain entry to the Service Building on weekdays between 6pm and 6am and at all times on weekends and during holidays (when the university is closed.)
accidents or injury on the job
If an accident occurs on the job, the employee should immediately report the accident to the Supervisor on Call. In order to assure that medical expenses and lost work time will be compensated (even if only the possibility of this exists), the employee must report the accident within 24-hours and complete a “First Report of Injury” form (available from Center Bay.) Medical attention is available at the University Health Center for those injuries which require medical review/attention. If transportation is needed to the University Health Center, the section supervisor should be immediately contacted for instructions. If an injury “on the job” prevents an employee from fulfilling work commitments, employees may be partially compensated for lost work time. In order to be eligible for compensation, employees must receive approval from their section managers (to verify that the injury was work-related) and may be required to provide specific types of medical documentation and be off work for more than three days.
Students may be partially compensated for lost work days due to a job related injury. The first three days are usually not compensated, however, if an injury keeps someone off work for more than three days, the employee may receive partial compensation for lost work shifts from the State’s Worker’s Compensation Carrier. If the disability extends to two weeks or more the State of Maryland will consider the first three (3) days of time lost from work to be compensable time. Students in part-time positions may be compensated for lost time only if their supervisor cannot arrange for the student to make up missed shifts. The compensation for part time workers will be based on the average number of hours worked per week by the employee. When necessary, compensation will be provided up to the end of the employment period during which the injury occurred.
To be eligible for any form of compensation for lost work time, employees must immediately complete the necessary forms with their supervisor and the Employee Services Office.
Safe & Sick leave
Hourly employees that regularly work a minimum of 12 hours per week and are at least 18 years old are eligible for safe and sick leave. Staff accrue leave at a rate roughly of one hour per every 30 hours worked and must be employed 106 days before they are eligible to use the leave. Staff can check their balances via the www.timesheets.umd.edu website at any time.
Safe and sick leave is permitted to be used for the following reasons:
To care for or treat the employee’s mental or physical illness or condition
To obtain preventive medical care for the employee or the employee’s family member
To care for a family member with mental or physical illness, injury or condition
For maternity or paternity leave
The absence from work is necessary due to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking committed against the employee or the employee’s family member.
Employees may not earn more than 40 hours of sick and safe leave in a calendar year and may not carry over more than 40 hours of accrued sick and safe leave into the subsequent calendar year. Employees will stop accruing biweekly sick and safe leave once their accrued sick and safe leave bank balance reaches 64 hours at any time during the calendar year. Employees may not use more than 64 hours of sick and safe leave in a calendar year. Employees are entitled to have any unused sick and safe leave reinstated if they are re-employed with 37 weeks of termination.
As it relates to the Service Center, staff are still expected to find coverage for their shifts if they want to use sick and safe leave. Using this leave does not remove the expectation of someone else working the shift if a staff member is not able to. Failing to show up to work or securing someone else to work will be considered a “no-show” and will result in disciplinary action.
alcohol / drug use policy
Employees should never report to work under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Employees who report to work or return from breaks or lunch/dinner periods and are judged to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be immediately sent home and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. Time missed from work will be documented as an unexcused absence.
Possession, transportation, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol during work hours will result in immediate employment termination. In addition, all drug-related incidents will be communicated to appropriate University and local authorities.
Employees on prescription medicine are advised to consult with their physician in advance about the possible effects of their medication while at work. Any medication which might influence an employee’s performance must be brought to the attention of the supervisor at the start of the work shift. In the event that the employee’s physician cautions against attempting to complete any or all job responsibilities, the employee must provide the supervisor with a doctor’s note. Employees may be terminated if they are abusing prescription drugs during work hours or are impaired during work hours due to the abuse of prescription drugs.
Student employees are obligated to comply with all provisions of the State of Maryland’s Substance
Abuse Policy, including, but not limited to:
a. Signing an acknowledgement of the policy;
b. Reporting any past drug convictions;
c. Reporting new drug convictions within five days to your supervisor;
d. Cooperating fully with law enforcement authorities in the investigation and prosecution of illegal drug or alcohol use.
sexual MISCONDUCT POLICY
The University of Maryland is committed to maintaining a working and learning environment in which students, faculty, and staff can develop intellectually, professionally, personally, and socially. Such an environment must be free of intimidation, fear, coercion, and reprisal. Accordingly, the Campus prohibits sexual harassment or misconduct. Sexual misconduct may cause others unjustifiable offense, anxiety, and injury. Sexual misconduct threatens the legitimate expectation of all members of the Campus community that academic or employment progress is determined by the publicly stated requirements of job and classroom performance, and that the Campus environment will not unreasonably impede work or study.
The Department of Residential Facilities supports and enforces the university’s Sexual Misconduct Policy. The policy applies to all full-time, part-time and student employees. To ensure that all staff are well informed about the topic of sexual misconduct, all staff including students are required to attend a Sexual Misconduct Training Program once every three years. This training covers campus policy, definitions, issues, resources, and how to file a complaint.
According to campus policy, sexual harassment is defined as:
(1) Unwelcome sexual advances;
(2) Unwelcome requests for sexual favors; and
(3) Other behavior of a sexual nature where:
a. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment or participation in University-sponsored education program or activity; or
b. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affecting that individual; or
c. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s academic or work performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational or work environment.
Both regular and student staff are expected to support and abide by the campus policy on sexual misconduct. Staff are expected to treat other employees and customers with courtesy and respect and specifically, to refrain from behaviors, jokes, verbal comments or gestures that could be considered sexual and/or offensive in nature.
Be aware of how your behavior or comments are received by others, and be sensitive to individuals who may be offended by your behavior or language. If you witness behavior or language that you find offensive, confront the individual and/or report the incident through one of the reporting options described below.
Every complaint of sexual misconduct received is taken seriously and fully investigated. In the process, the department is committed to protecting the rights of all employees, whether they are subjected to sexual misconduct or are accused of an offense. To this end, we will work with any employee reporting sexual misconduct to attempt to resolve the complaint. Complaints can be filed with the following department and campus resources:
Your section supervisor - In the event that the harassment comes from co-workers in your own section, your supervisor is likely to be involved in any resolution of the problem, and may be in the best position to immediately change your work responsibilities to minimize further problems until the situation is resolved.
Assistant to the Director, Employee Services - This individual is responsible for managing all complaints, and serves as the liaison with the Campus Legal Office on issues of sexual harassment.
Other department managers or supervisors - Discussing the issue of sexual harassment can be awkward at best and you may find it easier to report a problem to someone else in the department with whom you are comfortable.
Other Campus Offices - Complaints can also be filed with a number of campus offices, including the President’s Legal Office and the Office of Diversity Education & Compliance.
Understand that any campus official who receives a complaint is required to report the complaint to the President’s Legal Office. While strict confidentiality cannot be promised, we share information about complaints only with those staff who have a need to know (President’s Legal Office, department director, section supervisor).
If a staff member is found responsible for sexually harassing behavior, they face disciplinary sanctions ranging from written warnings to termination of employment, depending upon the nature and severity of the incident.
employment records
Each employee will have a permanent employment record created and maintained for the duration of their employment period. Supervisors may regularly place performance information, work schedules and any important correspondence in the file.
Although students may not prevent items from being placed in their file, they may request to have additional documentation included that pertains to their satisfactory or unsatisfactory performance.
Access to an employee’s personnel file will be limited to payroll personnel and authorized DRF employees. Employment records (job history, performance evaluations, etc.) can be made available to persons outside the department only upon a student’s formal request. Employees should be aware that their employment records will be stored for 5 years after their employment ends with the department. Without a formal release from the employee, only confirmations of employment, employment dates and salary verification will be released to inquirers.
Desk Associates needing references or recommendations from full time staff may request these at any time during or after their employment. Staff should be courteous and allow as much time as possible for the recommendation to be completed. Many full time staff will need at least a week’s notice in order to complete such a recommendation.
service center employee probationary period
All students hired for the first time at the Service Center will begin their employment on probationary status for a period of 6-8 weeks (time varies based on the training program). During this time, the new staff member will work “Training Shifts” alongside Service Center staff members who are designated as qualified trainers and have signed up to assist with these shifts. Service Center management, supervisors, and qualified trainers may all be asked to assist in training new employees and monitoring their performance. The designated trainer will supply feedback during and after the shift and report his or her evaluation to a supervisor afterwards.
The purpose of the probationary period is to provide an opportunity for both the supervisor and the employee to evaluate the mutual desirability of the work placement. Specific terms and conditions to be met prior to the end of the probation period will be outlined by your supervisor and/or designated trainer.
During the probationary period, employee performance will be observed and evaluated. Anyone who is rejected while on probation will be given fair notice and will typically have received at least one verbal warning. The probationary period, however, does not prohibit immediate dismissal without counseling or warning in cases of gross negligence, incompetence, or a serious breach of policy.
At the end of the probationary period, once all shadow shifts, independent shifts and quizzes have been completed, new staff will be given a comprehensive exam on which they must earn a minimum of 90%. If the minimum is not obtained on the exam, the probation period will be extended by one week, at which time the new employee shall be given a second chance to pass the exam. Failure to earn a minimum of 90% on the re-test will result in termination from the Service Center.
Probationary employees may be dismissed, at the supervisor’s discretion, for:
a. violations of policies;
b. unsatisfactory work performance;
c. poor work attitudes which adversely affect the morale and productivity of the work group; or
poor productivity (inability to complete routine tasks during a work shift).
Performance evaluation
Desk Associates employment performance will be evaluated by their supervisor(s) on a consistent and regular basis. There is a formal performance evaluation process held at the end of each semester for Service Center Desk Associates. The process has been designed to facilitate educational conversations and is not intended to be punitive in nature. This evaluation is one of the factors considered when deciding a staff member’s eligibility for a pay raise, promotional opportunities, or as a condition of continued employment. In addition, evaluations assist managers in determining what areas of training staff may need additional assistance.
A discussion meeting will occur between the Desk Associate and supervisor(s) and have the following objectives:
Developing a clear understanding concerning the performance of the staff member using specific instances and appropriate evidence and/or documentation;
Acknowledging good performance;
Noting unsatisfactory performance and making specific recommendations to improve performance if the staff member’s employment will be continued.
A copy of the current evaluation tool can be found in Appendix C on page 27. Additionally, other desk associates may provide feedback about other staff members or any suggestions about the Service Center in the feedback box located to the right located to the right of Zak’s office.
Unsatisfactory performance & discipline
If a supervisor believes an employee is being deliberately non-productive or uncooperative, they may end the person’s work shift at any point and require them to leave the work area. Such an action will be followed by one of the disciplinary job actions listed below.
In the event of employee misconduct, failure to meet minimum performance requirements or failure to improve areas identified during a formal performance evaluation, disciplinary action may be taken by a supervisor. To promote fairness in disciplinary responses, there are standard sanctioning guidelines. Please keep in mind that in every sanctioning situation, there are mitigating and aggravating circumstances that may affect the sanction an individual may receive. Disciplinary action may take the form of verbal warnings, written warnings, probation, suspension or termination. Violations of a serious nature may result in immediate termination of employment. Depending on the circumstances and the seriousness of an incident or performance deficit, the supervisor may take any of the following measures against an employee:
Verbal Warning – A verbal warning may be given for unsatisfactory performance in a noncritical work area, such as failure to complete a task, reporting to work a few minutes late, failing to follow proper administrative procedures, failure to meet basic customer service expectations, etc. Some initial incidents of misconduct may result in a verbal warning. Verbal warnings may be personally noted by a supervisor but are not made a part of an employee’s permanent employment record.
Written Warning – A written warning may be given for the first instance of a more serious misconduct or unsatisfactory performance in a noncritical work area where a verbal warning is inappropriate or when a verbal warning has already been issued. Behaviors such as repeated lateness to work, taking extended breaks or lunch/dinner periods, missing a shift, personal telephone use and most second incidents of non-serious misconduct will result in written warnings and become a part of the employee’s employment record.
Probation – An employee may be placed on probation for unsatisfactory performance in a critical work area, single serious incidents of misconduct, or repeated incidents of non-serious misconduct. Recurrence of problems cited with a verbal or written warning may lead to probation. Examples of employee behavior that might lead to probation include: repeated or excessive lateness to work, key and access card mishandling, missing a second shift, falling asleep at the Service Center Desk, allowing a non-authorized individual behind the Service Center, unexcused absence from a staff meeting or training, etc. An employee will be placed on probation for a specified time period. This probation period may be extended should another infraction occur during the probationary time period. Probations are made part of the employee’s permanent file and may result in ineligibility for a pay increase during the next employment period.
Suspension – An employee may be suspended for a designated time period in place of, or in addition to placing the employee on probation. A suspension would typically occur after a staff member’s second missed shift, serious mishandling of something such as a key or swipe card checkout, leaving the Service Center unattended for more than 5 minutes or for something the employee has already been placed on probation for. Suspensions are made part of the employee’s permanent file and may result in ineligibility for a pay increase during the next employment period.
Employment Termination – An employee may have their employment terminated upon single incidents of serious misconduct, completely defiant performance in a critical work area, or prolonged periods during which performance is unsatisfactory or repeated incidents of non-serious misconduct occur. Failure to improve performance that resulted in job probation may also result in employment terminations. Examples of employee behavior that may lead to termination include: stealing, fighting, numerous unexcused absences, repeated key and access card mishandling, master key loss, incidents of alcohol/drug use or intoxication during work hours, falsifying time worked, theft of university property, etc. Documentation of termination will be made a permanent part of the employment record.
Employees terminated from a DRF position for performance-related reasons who later reapply for any DRF employment must indicate their prior termination or dismissal on their application. Employees working two different positions at DRF who are terminated or forced to resign from one of the positions for performance reasons will have their employment status reviewed. Serious incidents leading to termination in one position, such as theft, alcohol/drug use on the job, assault of a fellow employee, etc. will likely lead to termination from other positions. In other instances, employment may be continued but a disciplinary job action may be applied to the remaining job.
appeal process
Any student may appeal an employment action to the next designated supervisory level. Appeals may be submitted as a result of suspension or termination. Warnings and probation may not be appealed. Appeals must be received by the designated supervisor within 5 business days from the date of the letter informing the staff member of the suspension or termination. The appeal letter should be in written form and should state the reason for the requested review plus provide documentation to support their appeal. A date will be assigned at the earliest practical time (within 10 business days) for an appeal hearing meeting to occur. An employee making an appeal may have one person present to support their claim that is a witness to facts relevant to the action under appeal. The involved supervisor will be present at the hearing and may present witnesses and facts which support their action/decision. A final decision regarding the appeal will be made by the hearing office (next supervisory level) with 5 business days of the appeal hearing date.
resignation
Staff who wish to resign from their Service Center position are expected to provide a minimum of two-week’s notice in writing. With that, more notice is always appreciated though. Failure to provide the minimum notice may make the staff member ineligible for future departmental employment and could be noted on future reference checks or employment verification checks.
During the summer, if a staff member is living in staff housing and resigns before the end of the agreed upon summer work period or is terminated, they will become ineligible for housing at the incentive rate. As a result, staff will be back billed at the staff rate, which is half of the summer school rate.
Priority points
Priority points are accumulated as a reward for the length of employment with the Service Center, special situations, for good performance during the employment period and for work completed. Employees can also lose priority points if work performance is not at an acceptable level. Priority points are used to determine the order in which staff schedule shifts and, if needed, are assigned shifts.
A priority point list is maintained by Service Center Management team and (ideally) updated weekly but always prior to each scheduling meeting. A priority log sheet will be kept on each staff member and can be reviewed by the staff member at their request. See the Appendix B on page 26 for the list of ways staff can earn / lose priority points.
If someone resigns (in good standing) their position at the Service Center, that person’s priority points will remain the same for 6 months following their resignation. If that person returns after 6 months and within 1 year calendar year, their priority points will be reset to zero since they will need to be retrained on new policies and procedures.
Scheduling
Employees will be expected to work a minimum of 4-5 shifts, or 12-15 hours each week. Service Center student staff must work 12 weeks and accumulate 120 hours worked per academic semester with satisfactory work performance in order to meet the wage increase requirements. For the summer, it is 10 weeks and 150 hours to meet the wage increase requirements.
No student employee may work more than 40 hours in a week (with all combined campus jobs.) Service Center staff may not work more than 12 consecutive hours (4 shifts) within a 24-hour period, unless there is an emergency situation, such as someone is unable to fill a shift with a legitimate excuse, a weather related event, etc. Students are required to receive a Service Center Management staff member’s approval to work more than 12 consecutive hours during a 24-hour period. In addition, this policy protects the well-being of the employee, incorporates stress management strategies (prevention of burnout, sustained production level, etc.) and allows our staff to stay focused so they can continue providing excellent customer service. If someone is granted permission to work more than 12 consecutive hours, they must clock out and take a minimum 15-minute break during the course of their hours worked.
The Service Center is a 365 days-a year, 24-hours a day, 7-days a week operation. It is a condition of employment that each Desk Associate be willing to work a minimum of one shift on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day, as it is the responsibility of all staff to make sure the Service Center is fully staffed these days. There is financial incentive pay for staff who do work these days. Additionally, staff will be required to work a minimum of one shift during each of the break periods (Winter and Spring). It is our first option to fill these shifts with volunteers. If we are unable to fill all positions with volunteers, we assign employees based on their priority point standing and the number of shifts they currently have selected in that particular week. These breaks and holidays are scheduled well in advance, during regular scheduling meetings, so staff can plan accordingly. The numbers of picks per turn may be altered at the Supervisors’ discretion to promote fairness and distribution of key shifts. The Supervisors will note any days of increased pay, special circumstances and other events.
A scheduling meeting is mandatory and is equivalent to a shift, meaning an unexcused absence or lateness can result in appropriate disciplinary job action and a loss of priority points (-25). Staff members who are unable to attend the meeting must receive an excused absence in advance from the Assistant Manager or Manager (not a Student Supervisor.) If approved, the person must also submit (in writing) to a staff member of their choice, hours that he/she is available to work during the scheduling time period. The chosen employee will then schedule shifts for the employee, but only after everyone else that is present has scheduled, so the employee forfeits their place in the priority point standings for not being present at the meeting. Unless it is a legitimate emergency, a staff member must give at least 48-hours notification of an absence for a scheduling meeting. If a staff member does not receive permission in advance to miss a meeting and therefore does not schedule, then they are not permitted to pick up shifts from other staff members until the current scheduling period has passed. Out of fairness to all staff, we do not allow student employees to “take a scheduling period off.” This means staff are expected to schedule and work year round. The only exception to this is for the summer, as we know some staff members live out of state and may return home and some staff may get an internship.
Blank schedules will be created and templates emailed out a week or so prior to the scheduling meeting. Staff are encouraged to review their availability in advance and come prepared to schedule shifts as efficiently as possible.
Supervisors begin by going through the priority point list (highest to lowest) until the schedule is filled or until no one wants any more shifts. Staff are permitted to select 2 shifts at a time, no matter the day of the week. Staff who have the highest average of computer entries over the prior scheduling period are awarded the opportunity to pick an additional 2 shifts each time, for a total of 4, if they choose. You must attend the staff meeting to be eligible for this receiving this incentive. Staff members who receive double shifts but do not attend the staff meeting are not eligible for the extra shifts. We keep a live tally of shifts taken so everyone is able to see where things stand as we proceed through each week.
If there are shifts still open at the end of scheduling, staff members who have not taken the minimum required shifts (3 shifts a week) are assigned first. Supervisors will begin assigning shifts based on number of shifts taken, starting from the bottom of the priority list, until all shifts are filled. The lowest ranked staff member with the fewest number of shifts is assigned first. Both of these factors determine the initial assignment distribution. For example, 3 shifts are open; person “A” has 4 shifts and person “B” has 3 shifts. The person at the bottom, person “B”, chooses which shift he/she wants. This person must continue to choose until their total number of shifts is equal to the person above them. If a staff member has a standing previous commitment such as a class or emergency situation that they have informed the Supervisor about in advance, they will not be assigned a shift in conflict with that commitment. Staff who have not filled the weekly minimum requirement will be assigned based only on their academic schedules.
From 9am to 6pm (0900-1800) the Service Center staffs 3 desk associates. While scheduling, desk associates are only able to choose from 2 out of 3 shifts, and the last one, which we call a “yellow”, is left until all shifts for the week have been picked/assigned. Supervisors begin by going through the priority point list where they last left off, and each staff member is permitted to pick one yellow shift. Staff members are not permitted to skip their turn scheduling to wait for a yellow shift. If a staff member skips their turn they are not eligible to schedule a yellow shift.
Please keep in mind that our operation does not close down and therefore all shifts must be filled and worked. Once a staff member picks or is assigned a shift, it is their responsibility to work the shift or arrange for coverage of the shift with another Desk Associate. If staff do not work or cover their shift, they will be subject to a priority points deduction and/or disciplinary job action.
Payroll
All student employees must complete payroll paperwork and be physically present in the Service Center payroll group before they are permitted to start training.
Student employees will be compensated at an hourly rate and are paid for shifts, training sessions and staff meetings. Staff must report their time worked using the time clock/card swipe system and any additional ways as requested by the Service Center Management staff.
The time clock/card swipe system is an official payroll record and employees should note the following restrictions:
Employees should only clock themselves in and out.
ID cards used for the time clock swipe system should only be used by the person who was issued the ID card.
Falsification of hours, deliberate clocking in/out of another person (or asking someone to do so) may result in employment termination.
Students should not clock in early or stay late without approval of their supervisor. Staff are expected not to clock in earlier than 5 minutes before their shift (unless given approval by a supervisor.) If an employee is late, they cannot stay to make up additional time at the end of a work shift. Staff may only stay late if they are handling an emergency, assisting during a peak time or covering for another staff member who is on their way.
Staff are expected to use their university ID card to clock in for work. If staff arrive and do not have their university ID card, they must document their arrival and departure times by signing and time-stamping a keyslip with their times. It is anticipated that use of the time-stamped keyslips will be rare. For each shift that an employee does not bring their university ID to clock in/out, he or she will lose 10 priority points. Repeatedly not clocking in with a university ID could result in additional job action. Students who lose their university ID card should have it replaced at the Mitchell Building before their next shift.
University student employees are permitted to work a total of 40 hours per week in all combined on campus jobs. Staff may not work over 40 hours in a week unless prior approval is given by the Service Center Manager or during opening weekend. It is the student’s responsibility to monitor their hours and not go over 40 hours in a week, in all of their campus jobs. Failure to monitor and abide by this policy could result in job action. 40 hours equates to no more than 13 shifts a week. International students are limited to 20 hours a week when classes are in session and must follow this policy or else they may not be permitted to continue working with us per federal guidelines.
Every student position in Residential Facilities is assigned to one of five wage groups on the basis of job demands and required skill levels. A specific range of hourly rates are assigned to each wage group scale (see Appendix A on page 25). Employees are hired at step one of their appropriate wage scale and progress one step higher on their wage scale after each successfully completed employment period (an employment period is defined by specific starting and ending dates for the fall, spring, and summer work period and usually coincides with academic class dates).
Employment periods are based on the university’s pay schedule and generally the academic calendar. They usually follow this schedule:
Fall – Pay Period 05 to Pay Period 12
Spring – Pay Period 13 to Pay Period 23
Summer – Pay Period 24 to Pay Period 04
To receive credit for an employment period, and be eligible for advancement to the next step, an employee must:
a. Possess a satisfactory performance record for the employment period. Employees who are placed on work probation (not the initial probationary period) during the course of an employment period may not be eligible for an increase.
b. Work a minimum of 120 total hours during the employment period.
c. Remain employed and on payroll for 12 consecutive weeks during the fall and spring semesters and 10 consecutive weeks during the summer (summer employees must complete the stated summer employment period for their position in order to receive wage increase credit for fall employment).
Students who have “earned” steps within their wage scale should be aware of the following practices:
a. Students who transfer from one position to another within DRF will not lose “steps” they have earned.
b. Employees who are terminated, transferred, or forced to resign for disciplinary (poor performance) reasons from a position and are re-hired in a different position (or the same position at a later time) within the department will begin at step 1 of the appropriate wage group.
c. Employees may have a break in consecutive employment for up to two employment periods and still retain their priority points, seniority or “steps” upon returning to a position in the Department’s student wage scale. Consequently, employees do not lose priority points, seniority or ‘steps” if they work only during the summer but not during the academic semesters. If the interruption in consecutive employment is for longer than two employment periods, the employee forfeits all priority points, seniority and “steps” and enters the position at the beginning wage level upon their return to employment.
During times in which there are “wage freezes” for University staff, student step increases may be discontinued until regular staff increases are reinstated.
In the following situations, students will be compensated at hourly rates different from those shown in Appendix A:
Students who are required to work during periods when the University is officially closed due to inclement weather will be compensated for hours worked at $1.00 above their normal hourly rate.
b. Students who work more than 40 hours within a weekly pay period Sunday to Saturday) will be compensated for hours worked (after the 40th hour) at 50% above their normal hourly rate (“time and a half” - your hourly rate multiplied by 1.5).
c. Non US Citizens working on a J-1 or F-1 visa may not work/be paid for any overtime hours. The University of Maryland is considered to be one employer. Therefore, students on J-1 or F-1 visa will not be permitted to work more than 20 hours a week total on campus when classes are in session and 40 hours a week when classes are not in session. People with F-1 or J-1 visas who are found to be working overtime hours may be terminated from employment.
d. Students who are required to work during designated holiday hours will be compensated for work at $4.00 per hour above their normal wage. Holiday hours are announced in advance each year and are usually limited to specific times during major holiday periods (4th of July, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve).
PAYCHECKS & PAYCHECK DISTRIBUTION
Staff are paid every other Friday and are expected to show a current photo ID in order to receive their paycheck in person. New payroll schedules will be distributed and posted in the Service Center each semester. They can also be obtained by visiting the DRF Payroll Office.
Paychecks cover the period that ended 3 weeks earlier. Due to this processing delay, new employees will typically receive their first paycheck 4-6 weeks after their first day of work. Students leaving employment with the department will typically receive two paychecks after the end of their employment.
Employees who work two jobs on campus will receive one check with all their hours combined each payday. Students who fall in this category will typically have their paycheck delivered to their original, first place of campus employment (not DRF.) A staff member may change this location by contacting the DRF Payroll Office and requesting to submit a change.
Each payday, paychecks will be distributed from the Center Bay area from 11:30am – 4:30pm. Paychecks not picked up during these times will be available between 8:30am – 4:30pm Monday – Friday, from personnel in Center Bay or the DRF Payroll Office. Unclaimed paychecks will eventually be returned to the State Comptroller’s Office.
In an emergency, employees may request that another person pick up their paycheck. In these circumstances, the person must submit an email to Lisa Amick (mamick@umd.edu) and also CC Trisha Lay (tlay@umd.edu). The email should list the name of the person who is authorized to pick up the paycheck and that person will need to present a current photo ID when they arrive to pick up the paycheck.
Staff may request to have their paycheck mailed to them on occasion (around break times.) Students should be prepared to leave a self-addressed stamped envelope for each paycheck with the Center Bay staff.
Employees are encouraged to sign up for direct deposit. Those who elect to do so will not receive a printed paystub, but can still access the information by visiting www.timesheets.umd.edu, logging in and clicking on “View / Print Bi-Weekly Earnings Statement”.
summer benefits
Summer housing will be offered to all summer student employees at a discounted rate as a way to encourage students to continue working for DRF for the summer. Since housing is an optional benefit, additional compensation is not provided for those employees who choose to live off-campus.
By working the entire summer employment period (including the weeks beginning the Monday before the residence halls open for the fall semester through Labor Day) staff will be able to earn a benefit (“staff incentive rate”) that reduces the charge to about half of what a resident would pay.
The department expects students will work the full summer period and arranges for students to initially be charged for housing at the cheaper “staff incentive rate.” If a student does not work through Labor Day, does not meet the minimum number of hours required (150) or is terminated prior to the end of summer, they will be billed at the “summer staff housing rate” for the period they lived in campus housing. After resigning or being terminated, students who stay in housing must pay the regular weekly rate and relocate from “staff housing” to “summer school” housing.
Students will not be back billed for summer housing if they have an agreement with their supervisor to only work part of the summer or if unusual circumstances require them to vacate their position early.
Students in summer staff housing may be required to move to an interim location while their summer rooms are being prepared after the spring check out and/or prior to the end of the summer to prepare summer assignments for fall opening. Additionally, summer staff may be required to move to a new apartment assignment at some point during the summer employment session to accommodate painting and carpeting schedules for summer apartments. As much advance notice as possible will be given to staff should these circumstances arise.
Staff choosing summer housing must conduct themselves in accordance with Resident Life rules, as outlined in the Conditions of Occupancy pamphlet. Staff who receive a housing sanction may have their employment status reviewed.
safety & security
Each Service Center employee, as a member of the larger campus community, plays a large role through his or her own individual actions in preserving and supporting security. Employees should understand that their actions or inactions could place themselves, on-campus residents, property or the university at risk. Each employee must therefore assure that his or her own actions support residence hall, fraternity and sorority security systems and policies that protect residents and their property from harm. Therefore, each employee must remain vigilant and aware of the ways in which building security may be affected by his or her actions.
Safety and security are important components of one’s workplace and must be protected at all times. Service Center employees must be aware of their personal safety and also job related security procedures. Staff should immediately call 911 from a campus phone or 301-405-3333 from their cell phone to gain assistance for themselves or a fellow staff member in need. (It’s important to dial the full UMPD emergency number from a cell phone rather than 911. Calling 911 may connect you to a different police dispatch that is not familiar with campus.)
For personal safety, please practice good habits and remember basic tips such as walking and parking in well-lit areas, have keys ready in your hand, look inside the car before getting in, know where emergency phones are located, minimize carrying cash or valuables, call ahead about departure and arrival times, avoid traveling alone and observe other actions that benefit your personal safety. Staff who work the graveyard, early morning or late night shifts (when it is dark outside) are highly encouraged to utilize NITE Ride as a safe means of traveling to/from work. When using NITE Ride, please be sure to plan ahead for the additional time it may take for you to arrive at work. NITE Ride operates 5:30pm to 7:30am seven days a week and is designed to serve the areas of campus that are not included on the evening Shuttle UM service routes. Call 4-NITE (4-6483) to coordinate a ride. Staff can also contact the non-emergency police at 301-405-3555 to request a police escort back. Both services are free of charge, but could take at least 30 minutes so call in advance to arrange.
The Service Center and DRF have well documented security procedures. Please become familiar with these procedures. Be up-to-date on things such as key policies, evacuation procedures, police and fire notifications, lock-up procedures and emergency situation expectations.
To ensure your safety and security while working at the Service Center, the door into the Service Center is locked 24/7. Staff should not prop this door open, as doing so puts yourself and others at risk and also jeopardizes the integrity of our security system. Service Center staff, DRF staff and guests of the Assistant Manager and/or Manager are the only ones permitted into the Service Center area.
All staff entering the building are required to swipe in using their UM ID card. Staff without an ID card must sign in and out on the log maintained at the Service Center Desk. This applies to all staff, both Service Center and others who enter the building. Service Center staff should not “buzz in” co-workers, friends or anyone else unless they first sign in on the log. Failure to follow these procedures will result in disciplinary action.
If a fire alarm should sound, staff are required to immediately stop working, secure the Service Center and vacate the building as soon as possible. Staff should use the appropriate keys to lock and secure the key cabinet file drawers and the larger grey cabinet. After this, staff should follow the correct protocol covered during training.
key and access card security and use
One of the major responsibilities of the Service Center Desk is ensuring the safety and security of keys and swipe access cards. Therefore, as mentioned before in the above section, only Service Center or approved DRF staff are permitted to be in the Service Center area. Desk Associates are not permitted to allow friends into the Service Center for any reason without prior approval from the Service Center Manager, Assistant Manager or Assistant Director. Failure to abide by this policy could result in serious disciplinary action.
In order to maintain the integrity of our key security system, only the Service Center Assistant Manager, Manager or Assistant Director can authorize keys to be signed out by Service Center staff. Desk Associates may not sign out keys or swipe cards for their work or personal use. The only exceptions to this policy are the Service Center parking permit, which may be signed out to another Desk Associate, and key ring 980, used to secure the keyboxes and Service Center in the event of an emergency.
Employees are required to show their University ID card and contractors are required to show their driver’s license or another form of government issued ID when requesting keys or swipe cards from the Service Center. Staff may not borrow keys/swipe cards from Resident Life or from any location other than the Service Center or other designated Residential Facilities keybox. Once issued, the person who signed the key or swipe card out is responsible for it. It cannot be transferred to another individual.
Once requested and signed out to an employee, keys are to be placed on key rings or other key control devices, such as a key back, not carried loosely by employees in their pockets. Keys and key backs are issued with belt loop clips to provide an additional measure of safety and security. Staff are required to affix their key back and belt loop clip to their clothing. Desk Associates should remind every person they issue a key to of this policy.
All keys, swipes and key rings issued daily from a key box location are intended for short-term use and are to be returned as soon as they are no longer needed and no later than the end of the work shift. Staff may not, for any reason, keep a key out overnight. Desk Associates are required to audit keys every shift and should immediately contact the Supervisor on Call should they determine a key or access card is missing. The importance of key and access card management cannot be overstated.
In the event that a key is stuck in a lock and cannot be removed, the employee must not leave the key in the lock unattended. The employee should obtain assistance to remove the key or break the key off in the lock, retaining the top portion of the key. Such occurrences should be immediately reported to the person’s supervisor.
Misuse of keys is a crime - it is unlawful under Maryland law to “use, distribute, manufacture, duplicate or possess keys capable of being used in locks in or on property owned or leased by the state, unless authorized to do so.” Employees in violation of state law or university or department policies will be subject to appropriate legal, (including personal liability for any fines) and disciplinary actions.
Access to resident living spaces is permitted only by the resident(s), assigned to occupy an individual bedroom, suite or apartment, their invited guests and visitors, and any authorized staff. Desk Associates must ensure their actions do not facilitate or provide access to any unauthorized individuals. Residential Facilities staff should only enter a resident’s space to complete tasks or Service Requests assigned to them, when a student specifically asks them to or to respond to an emergency.
When work requires entry into a Resident Life or Residential Facilities live-on staff apartment, employees must first attempt to make person to person contact with the staff member to request entry and receive permission. The Service Center will have a contact list available and staff should reach out to the occupant if need be for permission to sign out their apartment key.
Upon leaving an occupied space, Residential Facilities staff must lock all doors, windows and/or security screens which they passed through or opened while in the unit. This includes any which may have been unlocked when the staff member arrived.
Staff should also leave a note or copy of the Service Request explaining the nature of the visit, their name and any additional pertinent information.
umd alerts & campus early warning siren
UMD ALERT is a system that allows the University of Maryland’s Department of Public Safety to send text and email messages about emergencies to cell phones, pagers and email accounts. UMD ALERT is a connection to real-time updates, instructions on where to go, what to do or not do and who to contact for additional information.
University Police will determine (if an emergency occurs on campus) whether notification to the University Community should occur or not. UMPD will sent a text message and email to all registered devices if an emergency requires information be shared with students and staff.
UMD ALERT is a free service (your wireless carrier may charge you a fee to receive messages on your wireless device) available to all members of the University Community. To receive the alerts, one must sign up for a UMD ALERT account. Alerts will be sent to all devices listed in your UMD ALERT account. Individuals can sign up for the service by visiting www.alert.umd.edu or by sending a text message to 411911, keyword: UMD.
In the event that the campus emergency siren goes off, staff members should stay inside and locate up-to-date information about the emergency using www.umd.edu or 5-SNOW.
vehicle & motor transportation services information
The Service Center assists with signing out spare keys to all department vehicles and we also manage 4 vehicles for departmental use. These vehicles are signed out on a first-come, first served basis. Vehicles should only be used for official university related business and can only be issued to staff who have completed the Vehicle Driving Authorization Form. Seat belts must be worn at all times by occupants.
Staff should be issued the key and corresponding binder for the vehicle they are signing out. It is the staff member’s responsibility to fill out the vehicle log form with all the necessary information. Vehicles should first park in “state vehicle parking spaces”, then “service vehicles spaces” and finally in numbered or lettered lots. Vehicles should never be left unattended in fire lanes, dumpster approaches, unpaid parking meters or in handicap access spaces.
Vehicles should never be returned on empty. Once the gas level reaches ¼ of a tank, the driver should take the vehicle out to Motor Transportation Services (located at the Severn Building) on Greenbelt Rd and follow the re-fueling instructions in the vehicle binder. Motor Transportation Services is open 7:30am-4pm Monday – Friday. Outside of these hours, staff will need to check out an access card to gain entry to the facility.
Drivers who are involved in an accident should immediately report the incident to university police, their supervisor and complete the “Vehicle Accident Form” in the binder. Additional copies are available in Center Bay.
Staff are responsible for paying any tickets they are issued while driving a department vehicle. All tickets received must be reported to their supervisor by the end of the work shift.
In the event of a breakdown, staff should secure the vehicle as best as possible and contact Motor Pool at 5-5482 for assistance.
