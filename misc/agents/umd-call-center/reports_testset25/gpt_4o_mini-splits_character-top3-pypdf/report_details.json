{"recommendation": "To improve your RAG system, focus on enhancing the Generator and Rewriter components, as they currently score very low across various question types, particularly in handling simple, conversational, and distracting questions. Additionally, consider refining the training data or algorithms for retrieving and generating responses related to the \"Others\" and \"Resident Assistant Manuals\" topics, as their scores are also significantly lacking."}
