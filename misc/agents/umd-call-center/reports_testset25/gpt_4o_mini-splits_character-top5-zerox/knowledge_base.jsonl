The Resident Life Community Offices operate from 8:30am - 4:30pm, Monday through Friday, so the duty system provides around the clock coverage, ensuring staff accessibility during those hours when offices are closed."}
{"text":"Proper functioning of the duty system is essential to our management of the residence halls and is a primary purpose of having staff live and work in the halls. The duty team consists of individuals from each level of Resident Life. Community Staff will serve in on-duty and on-call duty capacities on nights, weekends, University holidays, and other unanticipated university closures. These staff members will address safety, security, health and well-being, and behavioral concerns that require immediate or urgent attention.\n\nMore specifically, the duty system provides the following:"}
{"text":"- Coordinated responses to emergency situations, including physiological, psychological, safety, security, and physical environment emergencies.\n- Staff presence in the halls at all times, ensuring para-professional and professional staff are readily accessible to residents for meetings, mediation of conflicts, responses to requests for assistance, and emergency\/crisis intervention.\n- Access to responsible staff member(s) for four primary stakeholder groups which the Department serves: resident students, families of those residents, Resident Life staff, other University staff in key agencies who work cooperatively with Resident Life.\n- Timely response and follow-up in situations involving potential liability and\/or requiring staff accountability."}

Since crises do not always happen during business hours, the duty system is vital to ensuring the safety and security of our residents. The RA on Duty is the first level of response within their area of responsibility and is expected to respond immediately to problems occurring in their designated area.\n\n# Duty Hours\n\nWe must maintain full duty response over times when University offices are closed (e.g., after weekday business hours, weekend, snow days, etc.). The fully duty duty hour schedule for all duty staff can be found in Appendix A. Each Community\u2019s RA Staff will operate its own duty system with one primary RA and one secondary RA on duty as indicated in Appendix B."}
