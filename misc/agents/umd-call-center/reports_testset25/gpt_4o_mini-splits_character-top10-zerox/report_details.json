{"recommendation": "To improve your RAG system, prioritize enhancing the Retriever and Rewriter components, particularly for Simple and Distracting questions, as these have critical scores of 0.0 and are limiting overall performance. Additionally, focus on diversifying and enriching the Knowledge Base, especially for topics with low performance, such as Emergency Procedures and Others, to ensure more balanced scoring across all topics."}
